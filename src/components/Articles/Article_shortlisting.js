                                        <p>Aspiring MS students always have this question of how to shortlist universities for MS. I've got good entrance scores, I've double buttered the recommenders and my SOP is in place. So, I definitely deserve to go to the top university in the USA. But, I don't know how to go about university selection- What are the probable criteria before I shortlist them, how many should I apply to, and application schedule, forms and deadlines, etc. Shortlisting a university is a critical stage in your journey from GRE to VISA and you can't (rather, you shouldn't) take it lightly.  </p>
                                        <h2>Hereâ€™s how you should apply to universities abroad and balance out the risk?</h2>
                                        <p>There is no rule book as to how many universities an applicant should consider and whether it's easy or difficult to get in. However, generally, students apply to 8-10 universities with 4 ambitious, 3 moderate and 2 safes. Three kinds of universities you should select
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Safe: Under this category, you should keep the universities that match your profile easily and you have the maximum number of chances of getting admission to those universities.

                                            </li>
                                            <li>Moderate: Under this category, you keep the universities whose selection criteria match your profile and you have the chances of getting into these universities based on your profile.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Ambitious: Under this category, you keep top universities whose selection criteria are difficult and the acceptance rate is less. These universities are difficult to get into.
                                            </li>


                                        </ul>
                                        <p>First and foremost thing is to look for the university which is offering the course of your choice. Other factors can take a back seat but your career depends on it. You can do extensive research to know more about it and the job prospects after pursuing that course.</p>

                                        <p>Of these, the most important factor is Course/Stream. Your future is decided most importantly by the course you opt for. Ask your seniors who have been there in the previous Fall and tell them about your interested course to get some feedback. You can also read about MS Courses on Yocket to know in-depth about each course, its specialisations and job prospects.

                                            Once you have finalised one or a maximum of two courses, start looking for the ideal universities. </p>

                                        </h2>

                                        <p>Although you can apply to as many universities as you want, however, this process is not free. For one application it can cost you around US $100, so, think about the number of universities you want to apply. Apart from this, sending GRE scores and TOEFL scores also cost you. Other than the free universities which you get at the time of registering for these exams, you have to pay for each university you are sending marks to. Sending GRE score to every university can cost you US $27 and $20 for sending TOEFL score with any university. </p>
